## Alumni Research Talks [Past]
* Along with [Vineet Pandey](https://vineetp13.github.io/) and [Swapnil Ghike](https://www.linkedin.com/in/swapnilghike/), I helped steer Alumni Research Talks (ART), a student-industry-research symposium which features research talks and discussions in Computer Science by BITS alumni currently in graduate schools or pursuing research in industry/academia.
* Since 2012, the five successful editions of the event saw some amazing alumni speakers including but not limited to [Dhruba Borthakur](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dhruba), [Ganesh Ananthanarayanan](https://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/ga/), [Chinmay Kulkarni](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~chinmayk/), [Partha Talukdar](https://parthatalukdar.github.io/), and [Ganesh Venkataraman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/npcomplete/).
* The different editions of ART have been supported by Microsoft Research, LinkedIn, Google, eBay-PayPal and NetApp. We are grateful for their generous support.
